  <p><strong>EPICUS</strong> is a fantasy strategy board game played on a collectible leather tabletop with a unique silkscreened grid. Forget computers — this is real-world strategy, alliances, betrayal, and arcane chaos.</p>

  <p>Form temporary alliances, then break them in glorious fashion. Coerce your friends to “help you kill the others”… until it’s time to settle the score.</p>

  <p><em>Will the wizard favor you on your next roll? Will he ignore you? Or worse — curse your path?</em><br>
  Only the wizard knows…</p>

  <p>Cast powerful spells, gain your own magical abilities, surround enemy troops, fire arrows across the battlefield, and transport forces into place before unleashing your final attack.</p>

  <p>Custom-designed, lead-free pewter pieces make up your army, carefully crafted for durability and feel. The hand-silkscreened leather board ensures every match feels as premium as it does unpredictable.</p>

  <p><strong>Every round changes. Every outcome surprises.</strong><br>
  <em>EPICUS</em> doesn't just test your strategy — it reveals your true nature.</p>

    <h2>An Epicus Tale</h2>
    <p>Since the time before man, a great Wizard dwelled on an island at the source of four mighty rivers, in a tower he raised from the earth itself. So bound was he to the land that the weather changed with his moods — and so it remained for countless millennia, until mankind arrived.</p>

    <p>At first, the Wizard welcomed these newcomers. He even taught them to shape stone and build towers of their own. But humans multiplied quickly and spread across the realm. Soon, they divided into four kingdoms, and four ambitious Kings rose to power.</p>

    <p>Over time, each King came to believe he alone should rule. In secret, each sought the Wizard’s favor to claim the title of supreme ruler. The Wizard, weary of mortal ambition, devised a plan.</p>

    <p>He summoned the four Kings to a grand council under the pretense of naming one among them as his chosen heir. Eager and prideful, they each believed it would be them. But when they arrived, the Wizard revealed his true purpose.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “I would give my allegiance only to the wisest mortal. Among you, I find no such wisdom. It must be proven who is most fit to rule.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Kings erupted into argument — each insisting they were the rightful choice — when suddenly the Wizard raised his voice once more:</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Silence. I will observe your actions and lend my aid to whomever I deem worthy. Now go, and let the realm reveal your true nature.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>And with that, the Wizard vanished into shadow. As the Kings returned to their strongholds, the Wizard smiled to himself. <em>“How easy it was to deceive them,”</em> he thought. <em>“Perhaps now, I shall be rid of them forever.”</em></p>

    <h3>Words from the Wizard</h3>
    <p>You have heard the tale of Epicus, and now your journey begins. Use your cunning. Show your bravery. Trust your skill. The dice are the key to the magic that guides the game.</p>

    <p>Alliances will be made — and broken — as needed. Backstabbing is common. Betrayal is strategy. <strong>Above all... NEVER DESPAIR.</strong> Just when you think all hope is lost, the Wizard may grant his favor and tilt fate in your favor.</p>

    <p>You are a great King and an intrepid warrior. But in the end... there can be only one true ruler.</p>
