  <p><strong>EPICUS</strong> is a fantasy strategy board game played on a collectible leather tabletop with a unique silkscreened grid. Forget computers — this is real-world strategy, alliances, betrayal, and arcane chaos.</p>

  <p>Form temporary alliances, then break them in glorious fashion. Coerce your friends to “help you kill the others”… until it’s time to settle the score.</p>

  <p><em>Will the wizard favor you on your next roll? Will he ignore you? Or worse — curse your path?</em><br>
  Only the wizard knows…</p>

  <p>Cast powerful spells, gain your own magical abilities, surround enemy troops, fire arrows across the battlefield, and transport forces into place before unleashing your final attack.</p>

  <p>Custom-designed, lead-free pewter pieces make up your army, carefully crafted for durability and feel. The hand-silkscreened leather board ensures every match feels as premium as it does unpredictable.</p>

  <p><strong>Every round changes. Every outcome surprises.</strong><br>
  <em>EPICUS</em> doesn't just test your strategy — it reveals your true nature.</p>
