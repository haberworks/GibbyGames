            Gibby Games started many years ago as a small Connecticut game design firm. Our first game, which we produced in limited print runs, was <strong>Epicus</strong>. The original limited edition Epicus prints were silk-screened onto a high-quality leather game board, used lead-free pewter miniatures, and came boxed in a leather quiver whose color matched your game board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our inspiration for Epicus came when reading instructions for all the other games on the market, and finding them too complex to actually figure out how to play. From this humble premise came an epic story of kings and wizards, magic and might, strategy and luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the beginning, we always knew that Epicus would not be our only game. Over the years we have developed many—all of which are simple to learn and addictively fun to play. Our level of quality and attention to detail in design has led us to our official corporate motto:
          </p>
      
          <blockquote>"Art for Game's Sake."</blockquote>
      
          <p>
            In addition to the design of the game, we have spent countless hours on every detail of our rules, removing ambiguities that may confuse our prospective players and ensuring clear, concise wording for all instruction. We hope you enjoy playing our games as much as we have enjoyed making them.
          </p>
      
          <p><strong>Thank you for playing!</strong></p>
